# Risk Credit Report Chrome Extension
## Get started
- Open chrome. In the URL, enter: `chrome://extensions` and turn Developer mode **on** in the top right. 
- In the top left of that page, click **Load unpacked** and add the folder which contains all of these files.
- (optional) Pin the chrome extension by clicking the puzzle piece in the top right, find Risk Credit Score extension, click the pin icon.
- Visit https://manifold.markets/ian
- Click extension in the top right, toggle it ON. 
- The page will refresh and- hopefully- you will see the RISK Credit Score appear. 

## Notes
- The `trash` folder is exactly what it sounds like- trash. It's just some code to quickly test stuff. That folder will not be in the production verison of this extension. 
- The options.html is a work-in-progress. The toggles don't do anything (yet).

## Have fun!
